## 🧠 System Design Mastery Plan: 4-Week Principal Track

### **Week 1: Foundations + Communication Framework**

**Goal:** Refresh core design concepts and set a strong communication baseline for interviews.

#### 🎯 Key Topics:

* Latency, throughput, availability, consistency
* CAP theorem, PACELC
* Load balancers, caching, CDN, sharding, replication
* Communication framework: \[Define → Decompose → Design → Discuss Tradeoffs → Deliver] 
  * [Tips_for_system_design.md](Tips_for_system_design.md)

#### 🔨 Tasks:

* Watch: [Gaurav Sen - Basics of System Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzLMhqg3_Wc)
* Read: [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)](Resources/Designing%20Data%20Intensive%20Applications.pdf) — Ch.1-3
* Design Exercise: **URL Shortener**

    * Focus: Data modeling, scalability, cache strategy
    * Output: Walk me through your mental model
* Communication Drill: Practice 2-minute framing: "How do you approach any system design problem?"

#### Principal Focus:

* Articulate how you'd align the architecture with **business goals** (e.g., latency SLAs vs. cost)

---

### **Week 2: Core Distributed Systems + Consistency Trade-offs**

**Goal:** Deep dive into reliability and consistency architectures.

#### 🎯 Key Topics:

* Leader election, quorum-based consensus
* Eventual vs. strong consistency
* Kafka vs. RabbitMQ vs. SQS
* Async vs sync flows (and orchestration vs choreography)
* Sagas and idempotency

#### 🔨 Tasks:

* Read: [Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA)](Resources/Designing%20Data%20Intensive%20Applications.pdf) Ch.4-6 + Jepsen blog on failure modes
* Design Exercise: **Real-time Collaborative Document Editor (e.g., Google Docs)**
    * Focus: CRDTs vs. Operational Transform
* Coding Optional: Implement a simplified distributed log with Java/Python
* Trade-off Deep Dive: When to favor availability over consistency?

#### Principal Focus:

* Call out when to use **Sagas vs. distributed locks** and why, based on business resilience needs.

---

### **Week 3: Scalability, Observability & Developer Velocity**

**Goal:** Build large-scale design muscle + think like a platform owner.

#### 🎯 Key Topics:

* Partitioning, replication, eventual consistency
* Observability: metrics, logs, traces
* CI/CD architecture
* Feature flagging, rollback strategies

#### 🔨 Tasks:

* Design Exercise: **YouTube-like Video Platform**

    * Focus: Upload flow, metadata service, caching, transcoding, delivery (CDN)
    * Think: hot content caching, region-based scaling
* Discuss: How would you evolve it to support live streaming?
* Build: A scalable logging architecture with Kafka + Elasticsearch
* Talk-through: How would you improve build velocity by 10x?

#### Principal Focus:

* Highlight **org-level enablement**: designing observability not just for monitoring but to empower engineers.

---

### **Week 4: Real Interview Mocks + GenAI/AIOps Tie-ins**

**Goal:** Synthesize all into interview-ready articulation.

#### 🎯 Key Topics:

* End-to-end architectural decisions
* ML inference at scale (tie into your GenAI tools)
* API Gateway vs. Service Mesh
* Multi-region architecture and disaster recovery

#### 🔨 Tasks:

* Design Exercise: **AI-assisted Developer Platform **

    * Focus: Prompt routing, feedback loop, telemetry
    * Think: LLM latency, cost, security in design
* Mock Interview (with me): Pick one of:

    * Global Notification System (e.g., WhatsApp/Meta Push Infra)
    * Payment Gateway (e.g., Stripe)
    * GitHub-like platform (versioning, forking, webhooks)
* Behavioral Tie-In: Practice “Architect vs. Coder” stories — how you drove business impact

#### Principal Focus:

* Explain not just “what you built” but “**why this architecture mattered to the business**”

---

## 🗂 Artifacts You’ll Produce:

* 4 system design diagrams
* 1 communication framework doc (your go-to intro framing)
* 1 “Principal Architect Signature Story” (e.g., GenAI platform or UBM)
* 3 design mock answers with business-impact tradeoffs
