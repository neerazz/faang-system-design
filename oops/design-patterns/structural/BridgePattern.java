/**
 * @implNote <br>
 * • We have a Shape abstract class (abstracter), and we have an DrawAPI interface (implementor). In order to Get a Shape we have to pass a DrawAPI as an input. <br>
 * ○ Shape class can have different implementations like Circle, Square, etc.<br>
 * ○ DrawAPI also can have many implementations, like RedCircle, GreenCircle, BlueSquare, etc.<br>
 * • Now while creating the Circle Shape object you don’t have to worry about the implementation of RedCircle.<br>
 * That part is abstracted out. That is the main implementation of Bridge pattern.<br>
