 * 1. Broker is a call that Takes a stock and execute a stock. <br>
 * 2. You have an Order interface that takes care of placing the order, and you can have many implementation of that. <br>
 * a. BuyStock, that will only buy a stock. <br>
 * b. SellStock, this will only sell a stock. <br>
 * 3. This pattern helps broker to take an order and execute that. <br>
 * a. Broker and end user doesn't know what and how the execution will be done. <br>
 * b. All it cares is to execute the order. <br>
